### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and addressing any violations promptly and fairly. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, discriminatory, or harmful. This includes educating community members about the Code of Conduct, providing guidance on respectful communication, and mediating conflicts when necessary. Special attention will be given to behaviors that could potentially compromise the project's security.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban individuals who violate the Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate, and strive to be transparent in their actions, while respecting the privacy of those involved. Decisions will be made with careful consideration and with the goal of fostering a positive and inclusive environment. They will also document all enforcement actions taken, maintaining a record of violations and resolutions. They are also responsible for regularly reviewing and updating the Code of Conduct to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Community leaders should be trained in conflict resolution, de-escalation techniques, and trauma-informed practices. They should also be aware of relevant legal and ethical considerations, including those related to data privacy and security. At least one community leader will have specialized knowledge of security best practices and vulnerability management.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, both online and offline, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. It also applies to interactions with community members in individual contexts if those interactions stem from their involvement in the community. This includes interactions outside of official community spaces when the behavior impacts the community's overall environment or creates a hostile environment for individual members. This Code of Conduct also extends to interactions with potential new members or those seeking to join the community, as well as interactions with individuals outside the community who are impacted by our activities. This Code of Conduct also applies to archived community spaces and resources. Furthermore, this Code of Conduct applies to all aspects of the project, including code contributions, documentation, testing, and security audits.

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, please report it to us. All reports will be treated with discretion, sensitivity, and investigated promptly and fairly. Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent that it does not impede a thorough and fair investigation and is legally permissible. We are committed to protecting the safety and well-being of our community members and fostering a culture of trust and respect. We encourage reporting even if you are unsure whether a violation has occurred. We also encourage you to report any concerns about the conduct of community leaders or enforcement practices. Anonymous reporting is permitted and encouraged where possible. Special care will be taken to protect the anonymity of reporters who are reporting security vulnerabilities.

We provide multiple reporting methods to ensure accessibility and comfort. Retaliation against anyone who reports a violation of this Code of Conduct is strictly prohibited and will be subject to further disciplinary action. We are also committed to protecting reporters from any form of retaliation or intimidation, including doxing, harassment, or discrimination. We will take steps to ensure that reporters are safe and supported throughout the reporting and investigation process. Support may include providing access to counseling services, legal advice, or other resources. For reports relating to security vulnerabilities, we will provide support in coordinating responsible disclosure.

### Reporting Methods

Reports can be made through the following channels:

*   **Email:** [conduct@example.com](mailto:conduct@example.com) This is the preferred method for reporting violations of the Code of Conduct. For security-related issues, please use the email address [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).
*   **Dedicated Form:** [Link to Form] (If available. Consider using a platform that supports anonymous reporting and allows attachments. Ensure the form is accessible and user-friendly.) Provide clear instructions on how to access and use the form. The form should include a section for specifying whether the report is anonymous and instructions on how to submit the report without revealing the reporter's identity. The form should also include a section for specifying if the report relates to a potential security vulnerability.
*   **Direct Message to Conduct Team:** (List names and contact information of designated community leaders/team. E.g., "You can directly message Jane Doe (@janedoe on platform) or John Smith (john.smith@example.com).") Designate a backup contact in case the primary contacts are unavailable. A group alias (e.g., @conduct-team on a platform like Slack) is preferred for ensuring timely response from available team members. Clearly state the preferred platform for direct messages. Provide information on the team members' areas of expertise and availability.
*   **Emergency Contact:** [Phone number for urgent matters] (Use sparingly and only for immediate safety concerns. This should be a direct line to someone authorized to take immediate action, such as a security team or law enforcement.) Clearly state the types of situations that warrant using the emergency contact. The emergency contact should be available 24/7.
*   **Encrypted Communication Channel:** [Instructions for using an encrypted communication channel, such as Signal or PGP, for sensitive reports]. This option is strongly recommended for reporting potential security vulnerabilities.

When making a report, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

*   Identifying information of the person who violated the Code of Conduct (if known). If you do not know their name, please provide any identifying details that you can, such as their username, profile picture, or any other information that could help us identify them.
*   The behavior that violated the Code of Conduct. Be as specific as possible, including what happened, when it happened, and where it happened.
*   The context surrounding the incident. Provide any background information that might be helpful in understanding the situation.
*   The approximate time of the behavior (if applicable), including timezone. This will help us investigate the incident more effectively.
*   Any witnesses (if applicable), including their contact information if possible. Witnesses can provide valuable information and perspectives.
*   Any other information you believe is relevant. This could include any previous interactions you have had with the person who violated the Code of Conduct, any relevant documentation, or any other information that you think might be helpful.
*   Include any relevant logs, screenshots, or other documentation. Anonymized information or summaries of conversations can also be helpful. Please ensure that any documentation you provide is accurate and complete. For security vulnerability reports, please provide detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability and any potential impact assessments.
*   Your preferred method of communication for follow-up. Let us know how you would like to be contacted and how often you would like to receive updates.
*   Information about any potential impact or harm caused by the violation.
*   A statement of what outcome you are hoping for, if any.
*   If the report relates to a security vulnerability, please indicate whether you would like to be acknowledged for your discovery.

All reports will be acknowledged within [Timeframe, e.g., 24-48 hours] and investigated as quickly as possible. The reporter will be kept informed of the progress of the investigation, within reasonable limits, and with consideration for the privacy of all parties involved. The investigation will be conducted objectively and impartially, considering all available evidence. The investigation process may involve interviewing witnesses, reviewing documentation, and consulting with experts. The investigation will be conducted by individuals who are trained in conflict resolution and Code of Conduct enforcement. For security vulnerability reports, the investigation will involve security experts and may include penetration testing and code reviews.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Minor offenses, first-time violations, or unintentional offenses. This also includes minor security lapses that do not pose a significant risk to the project or its users.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested, at the discretion of the conduct team and with consideration for the impacted party's preferences and the severity of the offense. Educational resources on inclusive language and respectful communication may also be provided. The individual may be asked to reflect on their behavior and suggest ways to prevent similar incidents in the future. This may also involve a facilitated conversation with the affected party, if all parties are willing and it is deemed appropriate by the conduct team. The conduct team may also require the individual to attend a workshop or training on diversity and inclusion. The individual may also be required to write a formal apology to the affected party. For security lapses, the individual may be required to undergo security training or code review training. The warning will be documented in the Code of Conduct enforcement log.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A more significant violation through a single incident or series of actions, or repeated minor offenses. Persistent or escalating behavior. This also includes more significant security lapses or negligent behavior that could potentially compromise the project's security.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. This may include a temporary restriction from interacting in specific community spaces (e.g., read-only access to forums, temporary suspension from chat, loss of privileges such as event speaking opportunities). No unsolicited interaction with the people involved, including those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. The violator may also be required to participate in diversity and inclusion training, seek mentorship on respectful communication, or participate in restorative justice practices. The conduct team may also require the individual to make a commitment to specific behavioral changes and set clear expectations for future interactions. A public statement acknowledging the violation and committing to change may also be required. The individual may be required to participate in community service or make a donation to a charity that supports diversity and inclusion. For security lapses, the individual may be required to undergo a formal security review of their code or contributions. The warning will be documented in the Code of Conduct enforcement log.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, or a pattern of repeated offenses. Actions that cause significant harm or distress to others. This also includes intentional or reckless actions that compromise the security of the project or its users.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. Upon return, the individual may be subject to probationary status with increased monitoring, required check-ins with the conduct team, and restrictions on their participation. Reinstatement may be contingent on demonstrating a commitment to positive change and ongoing engagement in relevant training or mentorship programs. The individual may also be required to complete a specific set of tasks to demonstrate their commitment to change, such as contributing to diversity and inclusion initiatives. The individual may be required to write a public apology and participate in a restorative justice process with the affected party. For security-related violations, the individual may be required to participate in a red team exercise to demonstrate their understanding of security vulnerabilities. The temporary ban will be documented in the Code of Conduct enforcement log.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or a single egregious offense. Actions that cause severe and lasting harm or create a hostile and unsafe environment. This includes intentionally introducing security vulnerabilities, disclosing vulnerabilities irresponsibly, or engaging in malicious activities that could compromise the project's integrity or user data.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. The individual's contributions may be removed or anonymized. The ban will be communicated to relevant platforms and communities to prevent further disruptive behavior and protect community members. In cases of severe misconduct, the conduct team may also consider reporting the incident to relevant authorities. The individual may also be publicly identified as having been banned for violating the Code of Conduct, depending on the severity of the offense and the need to protect the community. The individual's name and information may be added to a public list of banned individuals to prevent them from joining other communities. The permanent ban will be documented in the Code of Conduct enforcement log. For security-related violations, the incident may be reported to relevant security communities and law enforcement agencies.

### Appeals

Decisions regarding enforcement actions can be appealed by contacting the conduct team via [conduct@example.com](mailto:conduct@example.com). Appeals will be reviewed by a different member of the conduct team than the one who made the original decision, if possible, ensuring impartiality. If an entirely different member is not available, an outside mediator or advisor with expertise in conflict resolution and Code of Conduct enforcement will be consulted. The appeal must be submitted within [Number, e.g., 7] days of the enforcement action notification and should clearly state the grounds for the appeal, including any new information or mitigating circumstances that were not previously considered. The conduct team will acknowledge the appeal within [Timeframe, e.g., 24-48 hours] and provide a decision within [Timeframe, e.g., 7-14 days]. The decision on appeal is final, except in extraordinary circumstances where new and compelling evidence emerges that was not previously available. The appeal process may also involve a formal hearing with all parties involved. The appeal decision will be documented in the Code of Conduct enforcement log. If the appeal relates to a security vulnerability report, the appeal process will involve consultation with security experts.

### Data Retention

Reports and related data will be retained for [Number] years to ensure consistent enforcement and track patterns of behavior. Anonymized data may be used for statistical analysis and to improve the Code of Conduct and enforcement practices. Data will be stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel. Special care will be taken to protect the confidentiality of security vulnerability reports and related data.
