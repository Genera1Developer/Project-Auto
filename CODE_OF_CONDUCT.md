### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and addressing any violations promptly and fairly. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, discriminatory, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate, and strive to be transparent in their actions, while respecting the privacy of those involved.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, both online and offline, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. It also applies to interactions with community members in individual contexts if those interactions stem from their involvement in the community. This includes interactions outside of official community spaces when the behavior impacts the community's overall environment.

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, please report it to us. All reports will be treated with discretion, sensitivity, and investigated promptly and fairly. Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent that it does not impede a thorough and fair investigation and is legally permissible. We are committed to protecting the safety and well-being of our community members.

We provide multiple reporting methods to ensure accessibility and comfort. Retaliation against anyone who reports a violation of this Code of Conduct is strictly prohibited.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Minor offenses.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested, at the discretion of the conduct team and with consideration for the impacted party's preferences. Educational resources on inclusive language and respectful communication may also be provided. The individual may be asked to reflect on their behavior and suggest ways to prevent similar incidents in the future.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A more significant violation through a single incident or series of actions, or repeated minor offenses.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. This may include a temporary restriction from interacting in community spaces (e.g., read-only access to forums, temporary suspension from chat, loss of privileges). No unsolicited interaction with the people involved, including those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. The violator may also be required to participate in diversity and inclusion training, seek mentorship on respectful communication, or participate in restorative justice practices.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, or a pattern of repeated offenses.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. Upon return, the individual may be subject to probationary status with increased monitoring, required check-ins with the conduct team, and restrictions on their participation.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or a single egregious offense.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. The individual's contributions may be removed or anonymized. The ban will be communicated to relevant platforms and communities to prevent further disruptive behavior and protect community members.

### Appeals

Decisions regarding enforcement actions can be appealed by contacting the conduct team via [conduct@example.com](mailto:conduct@example.com). Appeals will be reviewed by a different member of the conduct team than the one who made the original decision, if possible, ensuring impartiality. If an entirely different member is not available, an outside mediator or advisor will be consulted. The appeal must be submitted within [Number, e.g., 7] days of the enforcement action notification and should clearly state the grounds for the appeal. The conduct team will acknowledge the appeal within [Timeframe, e.g., 24-48 hours] and provide a decision within [Timeframe, e.g., 7-14 days].
