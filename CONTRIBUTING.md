1.  **Install Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

2.  **Install Python:** This project requires Python 3.8 or higher. Download the latest version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation. Consider using a Python version manager like `pyenv` or `asdf` for managing multiple Python versions.
3.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine using:

    
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    

4.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Using virtual environments like `venv`, `poetry`, or `pipenv` is highly recommended. These tools simplify dependency resolution and environment management:

    *   Using `venv`:

        
        python3 -m venv venv
        
    *   Using `poetry`: Refer to [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation and usage.
    *   Using `pipenv`: Refer to [https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for installation and usage.

5.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   On Linux/macOS (using `venv`):

        
        source venv/bin/activate
        

    *   On Windows (using `venv`):

        
        venv\Scripts\activate
        
    *   Using `poetry`: `poetry shell`
    *   Using `pipenv`: `pipenv shell`

6.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the project dependencies. Choose the method that corresponds to your virtual environment manager:

    *   Using `venv`:

        
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
    *   Using `poetry`:

        
        poetry install
        
    *   Using `pipenv`:

        
        pipenv install --dev
        

7.  **Configure your Editor/IDE:** We recommend using VS Code with the Python extension. Configure your editor to use the virtual environment you created. Ensure your IDE uses `flake8` for linting, `pytest` for testing, and `black` for code formatting. Configure pre-commit hooks to automate code formatting and linting.
8.  **Set up Environment Variables:** Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the necessary values. It is recommended to use `python-dotenv` to load these.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by one or more project maintainers. The code review process is intended to:

*   Ensure code quality.
*   Verify that the changes meet the project's requirements and adhere to the project's coding style (PEP 8) and are formatted with `black`.
*   Identify potential bugs or issues.
*   Provide feedback on the code's clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
*   Ensure adequate test coverage.
*   Confirm security best practices are followed.

Please be responsive to feedback during the code review process. We may ask you to make changes to your code before it can be merged. Aim to address all comments and questions thoroughly and provide justifications where you disagree.

## Documentation Guidelines

*   All public functions, classes, and modules should be documented with docstrings following the Google style guide.
*   The documentation should be clear, concise, and accurate. Describe the purpose, arguments, and return values of each function or class.
*   Include examples of how to use the code where appropriate.
*   Consider adding diagrams or other visual aids to help explain complex concepts or system architecture.
*   Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes to the code.
*   When contributing new features, remember to add relevant documentation, including updating the `README.md` if necessary.
*   If the project uses a documentation generator like Sphinx, ensure your documentation is compatible and correctly rendered.

## Testing Guidelines

*   Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
*   Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
*   Use the `pytest` framework for writing and running tests.
*   Aim for high test coverage (ideally 100%). Use coverage reports to identify gaps in your testing.
*   Follow the existing testing conventions in the project.
*   Write tests that are independent and do not rely on external resources whenever possible. Use mocking where appropriate.
*   Consider using property-based testing to generate a wide range of test cases.
*   Include integration tests to verify the interaction between different components of the system.

## Commit Message Guidelines

*   Use a clear and concise commit message describing the changes.
*   Follow the conventional commits specification (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve a bug`, `docs: update documentation`, `refactor: improve code structure`).
*   Keep commit messages short and to the point but provide sufficient context.
*   Reference any related issues in the commit message (e.g., `Fixes #123`). If the commit closes the issue, use `Closes #123`.
*   Use imperative mood in the commit message (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
*   Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
*   Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.

## Style Guidelines

*   Adhere to PEP 8 coding style. Use a linter (like `flake8`) to check your code for style errors.
*   Use `black` to automatically format your code.
*   Use type hints for all function and method signatures.
*   Write clear and concise code.
*   Avoid code duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself).
*   Use meaningful variable and function names.
*   Follow the project's existing coding conventions.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   Create a pull request for each feature or bug fix.
*   Keep pull requests small and focused.
*   Write a clear and concise description of the changes in the pull request.
*   Reference any related issues in the pull request description.
*   Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
*   Run linters and formatters before submitting a pull request.
*   Address all comments and feedback from reviewers.
*   Squash commits into a single logical commit before merging.
*   Include screenshots or GIFs to illustrate visual changes, if applicable.
*   Provide clear instructions on how to test the changes.

## Dependency Management

*   Use `pip`, `poetry` or `pipenv` to manage project dependencies.
*   Update the `requirements.txt` file (or `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` if using poetry, or `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` if using pipenv) when adding or removing dependencies.
*   Specify version constraints for dependencies to ensure reproducibility.
*   Prefer specific version numbers over version ranges where possible, but consider using compatible release operators (e.g., `~=`) where appropriate.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Considerations

*   Be mindful of security vulnerabilities when writing code.
*   Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
*   Use secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).
*   Follow security best practices for handling sensitive data.
*   Report any security vulnerabilities you find to the project maintainers according to the project's security policy (if any).
*   Use static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using a dependency vulnerability scanner to identify vulnerable dependencies.
