1. **Install Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Install Python:** This project requires Python 3.8 or higher. Download the latest version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation. Consider using a Python version manager like `pyenv` or `asdf` for managing multiple Python versions. **Using a version manager is strongly recommended to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency across development environments.** It's also recommended to use a tool like `pyenv-virtualenv`, `conda`, or similar to manage virtual environments in conjunction with a version manager.

3. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine using:

   
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   

4. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Using virtual environments like `venv`, `poetry`, `pipenv`, or `conda` is highly recommended. These tools simplify dependency resolution and environment management. Choose **one** of the following methods:

   * **Using `venv`:**

     
     python3 -m venv venv
     

     It's also recommended to add `venv` to your `.gitignore` file.

   * **Using `conda`:**
     
     conda create --name myenv python=3.8
     conda activate myenv
     

   * **Using `poetry`:** Refer to [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation and usage.
   * **Using `pipenv`:** Refer to [https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for installation and usage.

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   * On Linux/macOS (using `venv`):

     
     source venv/bin/activate
     

   * On Windows (using `venv`):

     
     venv\Scripts\activate
     

   * Using `conda`: `conda activate myenv`
   * Using `poetry`: `poetry shell`
   * Using `pipenv`: `pipenv shell`

6. **Install Dependencies:** Install the project dependencies using the chosen virtual environment manager:

   * Using `venv`:

     
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     

   * Using `poetry`:

     
     poetry install
     

   * Using `pipenv`:

     
     pipenv install --dev
     

   * Using `conda`:

     
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     

7. **Configure your Editor/IDE:** We recommend using VS Code with the Python extension. Configure your editor to use the virtual environment you created. Ensure your IDE uses `flake8` for linting, `pytest` for testing, and `black` or `ruff` for code formatting. **It's highly recommended to configure pre-commit hooks to automate code formatting and linting, ensuring code quality and consistency.** Instructions for setting up pre-commit hooks are below.

8. **Set up Environment Variables:** Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the necessary values. It is recommended to use `python-dotenv` to load these. **Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive information to the repository. Never commit sensitive information to the repository. Double-check before committing.**

9. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**

    * Install `pre-commit`:
            
            pip install pre-commit
            

    * Install the git hooks:
            
            pre-commit install
            

    * Run pre-commit on all files
            
            pre-commit run --all-files
            
            This will run the configured linters and formatters on all files in the repository.

10. **Running the Project:** Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set, you can run the project. Refer to the project's README file or documentation for instructions on how to start the application.

11. **Testing:** This project uses `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, navigate to the project root directory and execute:
    
    pytest
    

12. **Linting and Formatting:** This project uses `flake8` for linting and `black` (or `ruff`) for code formatting. You can run these tools manually to check and format your code:

    * Linting (flake8):
      
      flake8 .
      

    * Formatting (black):
      
      black .
      
      or Formatting (ruff):
      
      ruff format .
      

13. **Making Contributions:**
    * Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
      
      git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
      

    * Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.
    * Push your branch to the remote repository:
      
      git push origin feature/your-feature-name
      

    * Create a pull request on GitHub.

    * Ensure all tests pass and the code adheres to the project's coding style.
