## Setting up your Development Environment

Before you can start contributing, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Install Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
2.  **Install Python 3.7+:** This project requires Python 3.7 or higher. Download the latest version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation.
3.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine using:
    
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    
4.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
    
    python3 -m venv venv
    
5.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   On Linux/macOS:
        
        source venv/bin/activate
        
    *   On Windows:
        
        venv\Scripts\activate
        
6.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the project dependencies using pip:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
7.  **Configure your Editor/IDE:** We recommend using VS Code with the Python extension. Configure your editor to use the virtual environment you created.
8.  **Set up Environment Variables:** Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the necessary values.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by one or more project maintainers. The code review process is intended to:

*   Ensure code quality.
*   Verify that the changes meet the project's requirements and adhere to the project's coding style (PEP 8).
*   Identify potential bugs or issues.
*   Provide feedback on the code's clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.

Please be responsive to feedback during the code review process. We may ask you to make changes to your code before it can be merged. Aim to address all comments and questions thoroughly.

## Documentation Guidelines

*   All public functions, classes, and modules should be documented with docstrings following the Google style guide.
*   The documentation should be clear, concise, and accurate. Describe the purpose, arguments, and return values of each function or class.
*   Include examples of how to use the code where appropriate.
*   Consider adding diagrams or other visual aids to help explain complex concepts or system architecture.
*   Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes to the code.
*   When contributing new features, remember to add relevant documentation.

## Testing Guidelines

*   Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
*   Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
*   Use the `pytest` framework for writing and running tests.
*   Aim for high test coverage.
*   Follow the existing testing conventions in the project.

## Commit Message Guidelines

*   Use a clear and concise commit message describing the changes.
*   Follow the conventional commits specification (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve a bug`).
*   Keep commit messages short and to the point.
*   Reference any related issues in the commit message (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
