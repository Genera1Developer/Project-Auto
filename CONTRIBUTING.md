## Setting up your Development Environment

Before you can start contributing, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Install Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
2.  **Install Python 3.8+:** This project requires Python 3.8 or higher. Download the latest version from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your PATH during installation.
3.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine using:
    
    
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    
    
4.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
    
    
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    
5.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   On Linux/macOS:
        
        
        source venv/bin/activate
        
        
    *   On Windows:
        
        
        venv\Scripts\activate
        
        
6.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the project dependencies using pip:
    
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
7.  **Configure your Editor/IDE:** We recommend using VS Code with the Python extension. Configure your editor to use the virtual environment you created. Ensure your IDE uses `flake8` and `pytest` for linting and testing respectively.
8.  **Set up Environment Variables:** Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and populate it with the necessary values.  It is recommended to use `python-dotenv` to load these.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by one or more project maintainers. The code review process is intended to:

*   Ensure code quality.
*   Verify that the changes meet the project's requirements and adhere to the project's coding style (PEP 8).
*   Identify potential bugs or issues.
*   Provide feedback on the code's clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
*   Ensure adequate test coverage.

Please be responsive to feedback during the code review process. We may ask you to make changes to your code before it can be merged. Aim to address all comments and questions thoroughly and provide justifications where you disagree.

## Documentation Guidelines

*   All public functions, classes, and modules should be documented with docstrings following the Google style guide.
*   The documentation should be clear, concise, and accurate. Describe the purpose, arguments, and return values of each function or class.
*   Include examples of how to use the code where appropriate.
*   Consider adding diagrams or other visual aids to help explain complex concepts or system architecture.
*   Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes to the code.
*   When contributing new features, remember to add relevant documentation, including updating the `README.md` if necessary.

## Testing Guidelines

*   Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
*   Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
*   Use the `pytest` framework for writing and running tests.
*   Aim for high test coverage (ideally 100%). Use coverage reports to identify gaps in your testing.
*   Follow the existing testing conventions in the project.
*   Write tests that are independent and do not rely on external resources whenever possible.  Use mocking where appropriate.

## Commit Message Guidelines

*   Use a clear and concise commit message describing the changes.
*   Follow the conventional commits specification (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: resolve a bug`, `docs: update documentation`, `refactor: improve code structure`).
*   Keep commit messages short and to the point, but provide sufficient context.
*   Reference any related issues in the commit message (e.g., `Fixes #123`). If the commit closes the issue, use `Closes #123`.
*   Use imperative mood in the commit message (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

## Style Guidelines

*   Adhere to PEP 8 coding style. Use a linter (like `flake8`) to check your code for style errors.
*   Use type hints for all function and method signatures.
*   Write clear and concise code.
*   Avoid code duplication.
*   Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   Create a pull request for each feature or bug fix.
*   Keep pull requests small and focused.
*   Write a clear and concise description of the changes in the pull request.
*   Reference any related issues in the pull request description.
*   Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
*   Address all comments and feedback from reviewers.
*   Squash commits into a single logical commit before merging.

## Dependency Management

*   Use `pip` to manage project dependencies.
*   Update the `requirements.txt` file when adding or removing dependencies.
*   Specify version constraints for dependencies to ensure reproducibility.
*   Prefer specific version numbers over version ranges where possible.

## Security Considerations

*   Be mindful of security vulnerabilities when writing code.
*   Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
*   Use secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.
*   Follow security best practices for handling sensitive data.
*   Report any security vulnerabilities you find to the project maintainers.
