# Setting Up Your Web Proxy

To use this proxy effectively within your static or dynamic site, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your server.
2.  **Embed Function:**

    *   Create a JavaScript function in your site to handle proxy requests. This function will dynamically generate the proxy URL.
3.  **Proxy Endpoint:**

    *   The proxy URL endpoint is `/api/proxy?url=${targetURL}`. Your server must be running for this to work.
4.  **User Input:**

    *   Implement a text input field where users can enter the target URL they want to access.
5.  **Redirection/Request:**

    *   Use a button or the Enter key to trigger the proxy request. The URL entered by the user should be properly encoded before being sent to the proxy.

### Example Implementation:

**HTML:**


<input type="text" id="urlInput" placeholder="Enter URL">
<button onclick="proxyRequest()">Go</button>
<script>
  function proxyRequest() {
    const url = document.getElementById('urlInput').value;
    const encodedURL = encodeURIComponent(url);
    window.location.href = `/api/proxy?url=${encodedURL}`;
  }
</script>


### Key Considerations:

*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to manage issues during the proxy request or with the target website. Display user-friendly error messages.
*   **Security:** Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. Validate and escape the URL.
*   **CORS:** Be aware of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. Configure your proxy server to set appropriate headers to avoid CORS issues.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect your server from excessive requests.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure your proxy supports HTTPS to encrypt data and protect user privacy.
*   **URL Encoding:** Always encode the URL using `encodeURIComponent()` in JavaScript before sending it to the proxy server.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure your CSP headers to allow resources from proxied origins.
*   **Blacklisting/Whitelisting:** Implement URL blacklisting or whitelisting to restrict access to certain websites.
*   **Header Management:** Carefully manage headers to prevent information leakage or security issues. Remove or sanitize sensitive headers.
*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring to track proxy usage and identify potential problems.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the proxy server and improve response times.
*   **WebSockets:** Consider supporting WebSockets if your proxy needs to handle real-time communication.
*   **Authentication:** Add authentication to restrict access to the proxy server.
*   **Bypass Detection:** Implement methods to bypass anti-bot and anti-proxy detection techniques employed by some websites.

By following these steps and considerations, you can set up a robust and secure web proxy. When testing, verify that the URL correctly transforms to `{yoursite}/api/proxy?url={encodedURL}`.
